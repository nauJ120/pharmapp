    <h1 class="tituloRetto protest-strike-regular">Who is The Amazing Spider-Man??</h1>
    <i class="text"> Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.[10] He has appeared
        in countless forms of media,
        including several animated TV series: the first original animated series Spider-Man,
        with Paul Soles voicing the titular character, a live-action television series,
        syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. Spider-Man was
        first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories,
        a recurring skit on The Electric Company from 1974 to 1977.[11]
        In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy,
        by Andrew Garfield in two films directed by Marc Webb,[12] and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland.
        Reeve Carney originally starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[13]
        Spider-Man was also voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the
        Spider-Verse,
        with the former reprising his role in the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. </i><br>

    <br><i class="text">Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
        Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
        Fantasy #15 (August 1962)
        in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games,
        novels, and plays.

        Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school
        student
        and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker
        died
        in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues
        and
        gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic
        interests
        Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and
        Venom.
        In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a
        radioactive spider.
        These powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance;
        clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called
        "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own
        design, which he uses both for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his
        powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he
        began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man. Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic
        book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Since his introduction, the
        main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school student to attending college to currently being
        somewhere in his late 20s.</i>
